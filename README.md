You are on the github repository for the game **Fields** that I made.
See this project [on itch.io](https://itsred-v2.itch.io/fields).

# Fields

**Fields** is a very simple "game" where you can create point charges and see the effects on the electrostatic field. 
The little vectors will point in the direction of the field and will be brighter the more intense the field is. 
This allows for a nice visualization of the electrostatic field.

**I had the idea of this game** in my physics class: I wanted to create a software to help visualise the electrostatic field. 
It is my first project in Godot.

## Controls

Controls are simple:
- **Left click**: select bodies and drag them around.
- **Right click**: drag the camera around.

When a body is selected, you can change its charge and mass on the GUI (Even though mass does *nothing* at the moment).

## In the future

If I ever find the motivation and time for it, my goal next is to add a physics simulation that you could run to see the bodies attracting or repulsing each other. 
I would also like to implement zooming in and out with the camera.
